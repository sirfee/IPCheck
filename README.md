# IPCheck
This was a service I wrote many years ago to check an external ip address and update the DNS server when it has changed.  This was to allow me to have remote connections to my home computer despite not having a static ip address.
The xml file holds the setting with the user name and passords for updating the site, and for an smtp to send emails to notify of any errors when updating.
